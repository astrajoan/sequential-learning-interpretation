# sequential learning interpretation
Deep learning, and in particular, recurrent neural networks, has in recent years gained nonstop interest with its successful application in a broad range of areas. These include handwriting recognition, natural language processing, speed recognition and so on. However, with the ever expanding use of such models, their interpretability or the mechanism of their decision making process have been understudied. Such interpretation can not only help users trust the models and predictions more, but also provide valuable insights into various areas, such as genetic modeling and linguistics, and help with model designs.

Here, we organized papers and articles from difference sources to provide a somewhat full-around overview of the development in this area.
